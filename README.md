## About GreenLight: A Mental Wellness Companion

### Overview
GreenLight is an app designed to support mental wellness in a compassionate, user-friendly, and innovative way. Born from the desire to make mental health care accessible and engaging, GreenLight serves as a personal companion for tracking, understanding, and improving your mental health.

## About me - Why did I want to make this app ?
Throughout my life, I've faced numerous challenges, including severe depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As of February 2024, I am emerging from one of the toughest periods, determined to make a positive impact. My experiences have motivated me to challenge the stigma surrounding mental health and provide a resource to help others manage their well-being. With this vision, I created an app designed to be a daily companion for anyone looking to understand and improve their mental health. This tool is not only for self-guided support but also serves as an additional resource for those receiving professional care. My hope is to illuminate the path to healing and open up conversations about mental health, making it easier for everyone to seek and find help.
